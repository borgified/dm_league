- LoL rules (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Elo_rating_system)
everyone starts at 1200 for first 10 games (could make it first 3 for us)
if above 1400, decays after 4 weeks of inactivity, 25 pts / week to a 1400 floor

HSharp
Allow any combination of factions ships servers and cores to see any trends for player preference, effectiveness with ship and if any ship/core combo seems cheesier. Obviously not going to get solid results with a small user base of SysX squad but stats are stats yo.
